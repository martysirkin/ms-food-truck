## Disclaimer

I am writing this document/code at (roughly!) a million miles an hour. I am trying to complete everything I'm setting out to do in 2 hours or so. Necessarily, there will not be time to complete everything I hope to complete. And I am sure I will forget some steps along the way. In the real world there would be time to review the document and to have others review it. I am sure you will understand if this work product is not 100% complete.

## Overview

Having worked for a long time in consulting, I love projects such as this. Having a (mostly) clean slate is awesome when we're trying to figure out how to provide a really wonderful solution for our customers.

Typically, in a real-world situation, I would follow a more standard consulting process (such as the quick one I am listing here).

- Gather requirements. Have the customer provide us with their thoughts/hopes/vision.
- Observing how they do what they do. Often, when they write up/describe their workflow, they forget crucial items.
- Speaking with the team. This (optimally) is not only the high-level people with whom we often interact, but also includes team members. The people who DO the work. Often, they will have a perspective that is VERY different than management, and can often be quite helpful.
- Create a proposal. I am a big believer in Agile development. However, I prefer something I call a "mixed mode" development process. In this process, there is a large requirements gathering step at the beginning, and a "design document" to outline the project, goals, necessary and hoped-for goals. Then the actual develrunopment can be scheduled (see below), and can be run under a more normal scrum process.
- Signoff. When possible, I believe in having the customer review the proposal, discuss it with us, modify it as needed, and sign off such that there is a complete understanding among the involved parties.
- Create a schedule that both parties find acceptable (and sign off on). This is the master "contract" for the project, including deliverables and timeline. 
- DO THE WORK (This is the real fun of the project). Typically, I like to run a pretty generic scrum process (depending on team size, commitments, etc...) with 1-2 week sprints (optimally 1 week). This involves setting up a system (JIRA is what I've most recently used and is fine, there are others).
- Monitoring the sprints. It is CRUICIAL that the project manager (me) track progress. The notion of "we're a little bit behind. Don't worry, we'll catch up" is fine. We all do it. Having said that, one MUST be realistic in how you run your projects. Delays can happen (some projects are critical, some have more slack). The most important point is to be honest/true to yourself, the customer, and the project. My typical mantra is: "The project WILL succeed, and on time. It is possible that some items will get added, some may get delayed/deferred. But the key milestones/goals MUST be achieved."
- Testing (see below)
- Documentation. As you can see from this document, I believe in very complete documentation of what is being delivered. This must take place in the project.
- Signoff. I also believe in the customer having the project/product delivered. Then they should test/question it. Finally, they should sign off on the successful completion of the project/product.

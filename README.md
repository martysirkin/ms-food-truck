## Overview

Having worked for a long time in consulting, I love projects such as this. Having a (mostly) clean slate is awesome when we're trying to figure out how to provide a really wonderful solution for our customers.

Typically, in a real-world situation, I would follow a more standard consulting process (such as the quick one I am listing here).

- Gather requirements. Have the customer provide us with their thoughts/hopes/vision.
- Observing how they do what they do. Often, when they write up/describe their workflow, they forget crucial items.
- Speaking with the team. This (optimally) is not only the high-level people with whom we often interact, but also includes team members. The people who DO the work. Often, they will have a perspective that is VERY different than management, and can often be quite helpful.
- Create a proposal. I am a big believer in Agile development. However, I prefer something I call a "mixed mode" development process. In this process, there is a large requirements gathering step at the beginning, and a "design document" to outline the project, goals, necessary and hoped-for goals. Then the actual develrunopment can be scheduled (see below), and can be run under a more normal scrum process.
- Signoff. When possible, I believe in having the customer review the proposal, discuss it with us, modify it as needed, and sign off such that there is a complete understanding among the involved parties.
